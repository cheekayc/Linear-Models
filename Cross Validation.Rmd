# Model selection

When you have lots of variables, you have to choose which ones will go in your model.

For nested models, you have tests
* You have to be worried about multiple comparisons and "fishiing"

For non-nested models, you don't have tests
* AIC/BIC/etc are traditional tools
* Balance goodness of fit with "complexity"

# Cross validation

Randomly split your data into "training" and "testing"
- "Training" is data you use to build your model
- "Testing" is data you use to evaluate out-of-sample fit
- Exact ratio depends on data size, but preferably 80/20
